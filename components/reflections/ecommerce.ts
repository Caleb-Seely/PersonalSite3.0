            I developed a fully <span class="text-[#10B981]">functional e-commerce website </span> for a client, utilizing React for the frontend and CommerceJS to handle backend operations, including inventory management and payment processing. The site was designed to be fully responsive and capable of efficiently handling thousands of users.

            I was approached with an open-ended request to establish an online presence for a small business. Over several weeks, I maintained <span class="text-[#10B981]">consistent communication</span> with the client, discussing style preferences, functionality, and evolving requirements. I provided weekly progress updates and made adjustments to accommodate their shifting needs. </br> </br>
            After launching the site and training the client on the backend system to effectively manage payments and inventory, I remained available to address any issues that arose from real-world use.
