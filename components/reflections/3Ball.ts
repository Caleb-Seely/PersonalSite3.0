            Developing <span class="text-[#10B981]">3Ball</span> was a comprehensive journey through mobile game development, allowing me to explore everything from physics-based gameplay to monetization strategies. This project taught me the full lifecycle of bringing an app from concept to publication on the Google Play Store.

            <li><strong class="text-[#10B981]">Game Development:</strong> - Designed and built the game in Unity with a fully functional UI, including a menu, help section, and play screen.</li> 
            <li><strong class="text-[#10B981]">Game Mechanics</strong> - Players earn points based on the number of balanced balls over time—more balls result in a faster score increase. Coins earned from scores can be used to add more balls or decrease their size, enhancing gameplay dynamics.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-[#10B981]">Ad Integration</strong> - Implemented an ad-based reward system, allowing players to earn an extra ball by watching an ad—introducing a monetization strategy while maintaining engagement. </li> 
            <li><strong class="text-[#10B981]">Settings Menu</strong> - Added various gameplay customization options, including a reset button, platform spin toggle, and a "chaos" button. The chaos mode, originally a bug in ball spawning, created an interesting visual effect and was intentionally included as a fun feature.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-[#10B981]">Scrolling Banner</strong> - Incorporated a scrolling banner to enhance the game’s aesthetic appeal and provide additional visual complexity. </li>

            I aimed to experience the full app development cycle, from concept to publishing on Google Play. While 3Ball was fully functional, I eventually had to take it down due to Google Play's Terms of Service requirements.</br> </br>
            This project provided valuable hands-on experience in mobile game design, UI development, and app monetization. Despite challenges, I'm proud of the final product and the skills I gained throughout the process.
